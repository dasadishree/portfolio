										<h2 class="major">CODING/COMPSCI EXPERIENCE</h2>
										<p>I have been coding since I was 7! Since then, I've worked on several small scale projects which can be viewed on my <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_878048817934282294633401/projects">Khan Academy      </a> page and 										<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_878048817934282294633401/projects">    GitHub</a>, attended hackathons, and competed in coding competitions. I am also currently secretary of my school's coding club! This summer, I participated in Girls Who Code's online Summer Immersion Program to grow my coding skills.</p>
										<p>I am also interested in cybersecurity. I have participated and ranked high in many CTFs and am ranked as a 2024 National Cyber Scholar and finalist from the CyberStart competition. In addition, I got a ~$3,000 scholarship to a SANS GIAC certification called GFACT and passed the exam with a 96%.</p>

										<h2 class="major">LEADERSHIP/TEAMWORK SKILLS & POSITIONS</h2>
										<p>I work well both in a team and independently. Currently I am part of the Marketing/PR and Finance team of a hackathon organization called <a href="https://teenhacksli.com/">TeenHacksLI</a> to organize a fall event. I am also president/founder of a youth organization called <a href="https://techfluences.webnode.page/">TechFluences</a> (scroll down to the TechFluences section for more info). I am also running a LLS team to fundraise for blood cancer, and as mentioned before, I'm secretary of my school's coding club. As you know, I am working with a team in my Headstarter fellowship as well to create a final project that has 1000 accounts made, earns $1,000 or has 1000 people waitlisted.</p>

										<p>My volunteer experience involves volunteering at a non-profit called <a href="https://hairweshare.org/">Hair We Share</a> to help maintain databases and their website, and tutoring and doing activities (including coding) with kids with a school program called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/herricksconnected/"> Herricks Connected</a>. I have also participated in several other small volunteer oppurtunities.</p>
